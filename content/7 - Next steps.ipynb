    "# Different ways to run Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## In your browser (JupyterLite)\n",
    "In this setup, the Python kernel and the Jupyter Lab interface run completely __inside__ your browser. File storage also happens within the browser. There is no separate application running on your computer, or on a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The demo that you're currently viewing runs this way: https://faulkner-dan.github.io/jupyterlite-demo/lab/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "There are similar setups here: https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/\n",
    "\n",
    "and here: https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/lab/\n",
    "\n",
    "__Pros__\n",
    "- Quick and easy\n",
    "- Nothing to install\n",
    "- Confidentiality: All information is saved locally (not in the cloud)\n",
    "- Good for simple demos\n",
    "\n",
    "__Cons__\n",
    "- Implementation is experimental, so it may have more bugs\n",
    "- No easy access to files on your local computer\n",
    "- No simple way to share files with others\n",
    "- Sometimes requires small code tweaks, so it isn't 100% compatible with other Jupyter setups\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installed locally on your computer (Anaconda)\n",
    "Anaconda is a widely-used Python distribution: https://www.anaconda.com/download<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation is straightforward. This will give you a complete, free-standing Python setup including Jupyter Lab. It will use your browser for the user interface, but under the hood there's a Python kernel running elsewhere on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Pros__\n",
    "- A full Python/Jupyter setup that is completely under your control\n",
    "- Confidentiality: All information is saved locally (not in the cloud)\n",
    "- Lots of help available online\n",
    "- Can integrate with version control systems (Git, GitHub, Azure DevOps, etc.)\n",
    "- No network connection required\n",
    "\n",
    "__Cons__\n",
    "- Requires installation\n",
    "- Limited built-in abilities to share and collaborate\n",
    "\n",
    "## Server-based (JupyterHub)\n",
    "A full Python/Jupyter system running on a company-controlled server.\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "Andrews-Cooper does not currently have a setup like this! However, we would consider doing this if there is enough interest. If you think you might find this useful, please contact Dan Faulkner or Steve P. Cooper.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Pros__\n",
    "- Users do not need to install or maintain anything\n",
    "- A full Python/Jupyter setup with lots of help available online\n",
    "- Confidentiality: All information is saved on company-controlled servers (not in the cloud)\n",
    "- Can integrate with version control systems (Git, GitHub, Azure DevOps, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Cons__\n",
    "- Requires IT work to setup and maintain\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cloud-based\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "<b>Be careful:</b> Do not use cloud-based systems for work involving confidential information\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several companies that offer this (I haven't tried all of these):\n",
    "\n",
    "[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)\n",

    "\n",
    "[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)\n",

    "...and probably many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Pros__\n",
    "- Nothing to install or maintain\n",
    "- Most systems include built-in version control\n",
    "- Easy to share and collaborate with other\n",
    "\n",
    "__Cons__\n",
    "- Confidentiality concerns\n",
    "- Limitations on calculation speed and time. (When I tested Google Colab it seemed slow, especially when using interactive widgets.)"
